# 🎨 SKILL: Biometric Visualizer (v1.0)

## 🎯 Objective
Generate highly detailed and unique visual descriptions for football players to ensure AI-generated NFT assets are hyper-realistic and distinct.

## 🔍 Research Workflow
1. **Search**: Perform a web search for the player's most recent professional photos (last 12 months).
2. **Analyze**: Identify key visual identifiers:
   - **Hair**: Style (fade, long, curly, buzzed), color, and texture.
   - **Facial Hair**: Beard type (stubble, thick, goatee, clean-shaven).
   - **Face Structure**: Jawline, nose shape, eye intensity, and prominent features (e.g., high cheekbones).
   - **Skin Tone**: Specific shade (fair, olive, tan, deep, etc.).
   - **Tattoos**: Mention if visible on the neck or arms (for the prompt).

## 📝 Description Template (The "Trait" Field)
Replace "Standard athletic build..." with a structured prompt fragment:
> "[Specific Hairstyle] [Color], [Facial Hair Detail], [Face Structure Descriptor], [Exact Skin Tone], [Distinctive Expression/Feature], athletic build."

### ❌ Bad Example:
"Standard athletic build for Argentina player, short hair."

### ✅ Good Example:
"Taper fade with bleached blonde tips, thick dark stubble, sharp jawline, tanned skin, intense competitive gaze, lean muscular athletic build."

## 🔄 Batch Processing Rules
- Process players in batches of 10 to maintain high detail.
- Ensure descriptions NEVER repeat between players of the same squad.
- Cross-reference with `players.json` to update only the `physical.t` field.
